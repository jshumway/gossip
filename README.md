gossip
======

A toy Gossip protocol implementation.

Symmetric `gossiper` nodes will discover and report each other's existence if allowed to run on the same network, creating a dynamic mesh of interconnected nodes.

Based off the gossip protocol from [Dynamo: Amazonâ€™s Highly Available Key-value Store (2007)](http://www.allthingsdistributed.com/files/amazon-dynamo-sosp2007.pdf).

An example of relatively bulletproof C networking code.
